## Getting Started

### 1. Install the SDK

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/auth0c/auth0-fastify/refs/heads/main/packages/auth0-fastify/setup.sh | bash
```

This library requires Node.js 20 LTS and newer LTS versions.

### 2. Register the Auth0 Fastify plugin

Register the Auth0 fastify plugin with the Fastify instance.


The `AUTH0_DOMAIN`, `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`, and `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET` can be obtained from the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com) once you've created an application. **This application must be a `Regular Web Application`**.

The `SESSION_SECRET` is the key used to encrypt the session cookie. You can generate a secret using `openssl`:

```shell
openssl rand -hex 64
```

The `APP_BASE_URL` is the URL that your application is running on. When developing locally, this is most commonly `http://localhost:3000`.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You will need to register the following URLs in your Auth0 Application via the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com):
>
> - Add `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` to the list of **Allowed Callback URLs**
> - Add `http://localhost:3000` to the list of **Allowed Logout URLs**

#### Routes

The SDK for Fastify Web Applications mounts 4 main routes:

1. `/auth/login`: the login route that the user will be redirected to to initiate an authentication transaction. Supports adding a `returnTo` querystring parameter to return to a specific URL after login.
2. `/auth/logout`: the logout route that must be added to your Auth0 application's Allowed Logout URLs
3. `/auth/callback`: the callback route that must be added to your Auth0 application's Allowed Callback URLs
4. `/auth/backchannel-logout`: the route that will receive a `logout_token` when a configured [Back-Channel Logout](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/login/logout/back-channel-logout) initiator occurs


To disable this behavior, you can set the `mountRoutes` option to `false` (it's true by default):

```ts
fastify.register(auth0, {
  mountRoutes: false
});
```

Additionally, by setting `mountConnectRoutes` to `true` (it's false by default) the SDK also can also mount 4 routes useful for account-linking:

1. `/auth/connect`: the route that the user will be redirected to to initiate account linking
2. `/auth/connect/callback`: the callback route for account linking that must be added to your Auth0 application's Allowed Callback URLs
3. `/auth/unconnect`: the route that the user will be redirected to to initiate account linking
4. `/auth/unconnect/callback`: the callback route for account linking that must be added to your Auth0 application's Allowed Callback URLs

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> When `mountRoutes` is set to `false`, setting `mountConnectRoutes` has no effect.

### 3. Adding Login and Logout

When using the built-in mounted routes, the user can be redirected to `/auth/login` to initiate the login flow and `/auth/logout` to log out.

```html
<a href="/auth/logout">Log out</a>
<a href="/auth/login">Log in</a
>
```

When not using the built-in routes, you want to call the SDK's `startInteractiveLogin()`, `completeInteractiveLogin()` and `logout()` methods:

```ts
fastify.get('/custom/login', async (request, reply) => {
  const authorizationUrl = await fastify.auth0Client.startInteractiveLogin(
    {
      authorizationParams: {
        // Custom URL to redirect back to after login to handle the callback.
        // Make sure to configure the URL in the Auth0 Dashboard as an Allowed Callback URL.
        redirect_uri: 'http://localhost:3000/custom/callback',
      }
    },
    { request, reply }
  );

  reply.redirect(authorizationUrl.href);
});


fastify.get('/custom/callback', async (request, reply) => {
  await fastify.auth0Client.completeInteractiveLogin(
    new URL(request.url, options.appBaseUrl),
    { request, reply }
  );

  reply.redirect('https://localhost:3000');
});

fastify.get('/custom/logout', async (request, reply) => {
  const logoutUrl = await auth0Client.logout({ returnTo: 'https://localhost:3000' }, { request, reply });

  reply.redirect(logoutUrl.href);
});
```


### 4. Protecting Routes

In order to protect a Fastify route, you can use the SDK's `getSession()` method in a custom preHandler:

```ts
async function hasSessionPreHandler(request: FastifyRequest, reply: FastifyReply) {
  const session = await fastify.auth0Client!.getSession({ request, reply });

  if (!session) {
    reply.redirect('/auth/login');
  }
}

fastify.get(
  '/profile',
  {
    preHandler: hasSessionPreHandler,
  },
  async (request, reply) => {
    const user = await fastify.auth0Client!.getUser({ request, reply });

    return reply.viewAsync('profile.ejs', {
      name: user!.name,
    });
  }
);
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The above is to protect server-side rendering routes by the means of a session, and not API routes using a bearer token. 


#### Requesting an Access Token to call an API

If you need to call an API on behalf of the user, you want to specify the `audience` parameter when registering the plugin. This will make the SDK request an access token for the specified audience when the user logs in.

```ts
fastify.register(fastifyAuth0, {
  domain: '<AUTH0_DOMAIN>',
  clientId: '<AUTH0_CLIENT_ID>',
  clientSecret: '<AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET>',
  audience: '<AUTH0_AUDIENCE>',
  appBaseUrl: '<APP_BASE_URL>',
  sessionSecret: '<SESSION_SECRET>',
});
```
The `AUTH0_AUDIENCE` is the identifier of the API you want to call. You can find this in the API section of the Auth0 dashboard.

Retrieving the token can be achieved by using `getAccessToken`:

```ts
const accessTokenResult = await fastify.auth0Client.getAccessToken({ request, reply });
console.log(accessTokenResult.accessToken);
```
